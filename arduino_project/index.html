  <p> I always like the good lighting in my room. I recently bought a strip light from Ikea. they worked pretty well but every time I want it to turn on, I have to do it manually as any light.
    <hr>Nothing wrong with that but How about if I make a project that turns the light for me and that is actually what I did.</hr>
The light strip still the same I haven't change anything. The light comes with a switch and a 12 V power supply, which is pretty safe compared to the 120 V of a regular lamp. </p>

    <p>Things that use:</p>

    <p>Relay (a relay module can work from 220 V and lower)</p>
<p>Arduino Uno</p>
<p>Cables </p>
<p>Double-sided PCB board</p>
<p>Ultrasonic sensor</p>

<p>After I connected everything using a regular breadboard, I then transferred all the wires to the PCB board and soldered them. 
  <hr>After the setup was done I used some double-sided tape to mount it below my desk, then I uploaded the code to the Arduino.</hr></p>

<hr>
const int trigPin = 6; 
const int echoPin = 5;
long duration;
int distance;
void setup() {
pinMode (9,OUTPUT);
pinMode (trigPin,OUTPUT);
pinMode (echoPin,INPUT);
Serial.begin(57600);</hr>
} 

<hr>
void loop() {
digitalWrite(trigPin,LOW);
delayMicroseconds (2);
digitalWrite(trigPin,HIGH);
delayMicroseconds (2);
digitalWrite(trigPin,LOW);
duration = pulseIn(echoPin,HIGH);
digitalWrite(trigPin,HIGH);</hr>
<hr> 
distance = duration*0.034/2;
Serial.print("Distance: ");
Serial.println(distance);
if (distance <=60)
{
   
digitalWrite(9,HIGH);
delay(500);
}
else
{
digitalWrite(9,LOW);
delay(500);</hr>
}
}
